# chatgpt_convo_saver
Save my own chats when im locked out of my OpenAI account


This tampermonkey script is made for people who cannot
export their data but are still somehow magically logged into
their chatgpt account.

The way it works is that it scrolls to the bottom of your
chat list and then clicks each chat, then saves the HTML
content of that chat. Unfortunately I do not have the
functionality to

- save chatgpt generated images, only user sent images in the chat
- view the contents of the html more cleanly, parsing it somehow with
beautifulsoup so that in the event your account gets deleted, we can
take those generated html files and view simply how the convo went

but maybe i will add those things later..
